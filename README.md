# Predictive-Coding-Network

## Introduction
This project began with an intriguing question from the field of neuroscience: how can the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in computer vision effectively detect illusory contours? Illusory contours are visual phenomena that occur in the human visual cortex, presenting a unique challenge for computational models.

## Objective
The aim was to create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model capable of identifying various polygon shapes, specifically focusing on illusory contours which traditional CNNs often fail to recognize. The ultimate goal was to develop a Predictive Coding Network (PCN) model that mimics the human visual cortex's processing techniques.

## Methods
We designed a DNN model that inputs these illusory contours and detects shapes ranging from triangles to octagons. Initial trials showed that while the model could identify conventional polygons with ease, the more complex illusory contours presented a significant challenge.

## Predictive Coding Network Integration
To address these challenges, we incorporated the Predictive Coding Network (PCN) into our model. The PCN, inspired by the functioning of the human visual cortex, aims to enhance the model's ability to detect intricate shapes by predicting sensory inputs and minimizing the prediction error.

## Results and Discussion
The integration of PCN into our detection model marked a significant improvement in the identification of illusory contours. The model started to emulate the sophisticated processing of the human visual cortex more closely, leading to better detection capabilities.

## Future Work
The project sets the stage for future exploration into how artificial intelligence can mimic complex biological processes. We look forward to further enhancing the PCN model and expanding its application in computer vision.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. Whether you're interested in improving the model, discussing neuroscience perspectives, or have other ideas, we'd like to hear from you.
